# The Order of the Closed Eye

In 2015 I made a video game at the Scripture Union summer camp Transformers. It uses Pygame and Easygame, the latter of which is a Python library by Dickon Reed and Adam Rowell designed to make 2D graphics intensive games programming as easy as possible. Easygame 6.0 is included in this repo (with permission) until the authors create an official channel for citation.

The only change that I have made to the code is removing one `print` function that I was using for debugging.

## How to run
* Make sure Pygame is installed.
* Either add Easygame to PYTHONPATH or put it in the same directory as TheOrderOfTheClosedEye.py
* Run TheOrderOfTheClosedEye.py with python.

The floor texture `Sprites/FloorTextureThing.bmp` is based on the Minecraft cobblestone texture (pre 1.14), as are its derivatives.

Honestly, the game is as good as I remember. I'm quite proud of 16-year-old me making this in a week. I have the code for two other games that I made, but they don't function at the moment and I don't recall how far they got in development. If I can debug them then I'll release them as well.
