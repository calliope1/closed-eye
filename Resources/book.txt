The great within spoke and said:
"The world in which you live is a deceitful one.
Lies and distrust manifest in all peoples.
You are the only truth you can know.
Close yourself to this deceitful world.
You may know the great within by doing this:
Be only true to yourself
For the great within knows no mercy and no love
Do not let others be true to you
The liars know only their own gains
And will never be truthful
Do not see, do not contribute
Your presence in this world means nothing
and by ceasing to be no one cares"
These are the rules the great within laid down.
The disciples took this message
And formed the Order of the Closed Eye.
Only by never being can one truly be.
